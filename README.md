The UWGeodynamics module facilitates prototyping of geodynamics models
using Underworld. It can be seen as a set of high-level functions within
the Underworld ecosystem. It is a means to quickly get the user into
Underworld modelling and assumes very little knowledge in coding. The
module make some assumptions based on how the user defines the boundary
conditions and the properties of the materials (rocks, phases). Its
simplicity comes with a relatively more rigid workflow (compared to the
classic Underworld functions). However, the user can easily break the
high level objects and get back to core Underworld function at any step
of model design.

The UWGeodynamics is inspired by the [Lithospheric Modelling Recipe
(LMR)](https://github.com/LukeMondy/lithospheric_modelling_recipe)
originally developed by Luke Mondy, Guillaume Duclaux and Patrice Rey
for Underworld 1. Some of the naming conventions have been reused to
facilitate the transition from LMR. The Rheological libraries is also
taken from LMR.

As we think the low-level interface is more flexible, and in so allows
for more complex models, we strongly encourage users to explore and
break the High Level functions.

We hope that the user will naturally move to the low-level
functionalities as he or her gets more confident, and by doing so will
access the wide range of possibilities offered by Underworld.

## UWGeodynamics and Underworld

*UWGeodynamics* uses the
[Underworld](https://github.com/underworldcode/underworld2) Application
Programming Interface (API). Both projects are supported by The
Underworld development team led by Louis Moresi and based in Melbourne,
Australia at the University of Melbourne and at Monash University.

*Underworld* and *UWGeodynamics* both provide powerful tools to develop
numerical geodynamic models. But their approaches are different:
*UWGeodynamics* largely guides users into a way of doing things. The
Underworld API provides a series of tools and components (Mesh, Mesh
variables, system of equations, functions) and leaves the responsibility
to arrange those components to the user. The main advantage of the
Underworld API is its flexibility. The main inconvenient resides in a
somewhat steeper learning curve. *UWGeodynamics* components are designed
to be more natural to non-experimented numerical modellers or people
with little knowledge in programming. It is a way to quickly get started
and design numerical models. Developing complex models can also be
facilitated by the *UWGeodynamics* high-level interface as it requires
less time and less involvement with the details of the Underworld API.

The two approaches are complementary and mixing the two approaches is
possible and highly encouraged.

### Note on versioning

Since version 1.0 The Underworld development team has decided to match
the *UWGeodynamics* version number with the latest supported version of
Underworld. UWGeodynamics v2.7 is then supporing Underworld up to
version 2.7.

The third number is used for *UWGeodynamics* only (v2.7.1, v2.7.2 etc.)

The development branch is based on the current *Underworld* development
branch.

## Quick Start / Testing

We provide a docker container via **Binder**.
This is a quick solution to get you started and run the examples and
tutorials without installing anything on your machine. That is a good
way to see if the software can actually be useful to you. The ressource
are however limited and you should not try to run model with high
resolution. 3D models can not be run in the binder.

## Where to find documentation?

The full documentation is available on
[ReadTheDocs](http://uwgeodynamics.readthedocs.org/)

Additional documentation and function specific documentation can be find
in the python doctrings. You can acces them in the
[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook by prepending or appending the
method, variable or function with `?`.

## Installation

### [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installation

Docker containers provide and easy-way to set up and distribute
applications. They also provide a safe and consistent environment which
facilitate debugging and reproducibility of models. The image we provide
contains all the dependencies and configuration files required to run
Underworld models. Users can start developping model as soon as they
have downloaded the image, independently of the operating system running
on their machine.

We strongly encourage users to run UWGeodynamics using the docker images
we provide on [Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/underworldcode/uwgeodynamics)

Different version of the [underworldcode/uwgeodynamics]{.title-ref}
image can be pulled using a tag:

1.  The *latest* tag points to the github master branch and uses the
    latest *underworld* release.
2.  The *dev* tag points to the github development and uses the
    development branch of *underworld*.
3.  release tags such as *v2.7.1* points to a specific version.

**Command line**

Once you have installed docker on your system you can *pull* the
*UWGeodynamics* official image as follow:

``` {.bash}
docker pull underworldcode/uwgeodynamics
```

You can list all the images available on your system as follow:

``` {.bash}
docker images
```

An image can be deleted as follow:

``` {.bash}
docker rmi underworldcode/uwgeodynamics
```

You can then start a docker container. (An instance of an image).

``` {.bash}
docker run -d \
   --name my_container \
   -p 8888:8888 \
   -v $HOME:/home/jovyan/workspace
   underworldcode/uwgeodynamics
```

You can access the container via your browser at the following address:
<http://localhost:8888>. Your directory [\$HOME]{.title-ref} should be
available at [/home/jovyan/workspace]{.title-ref}.

It is also possible to ssh into the container as follow:

``` {.bash}
docker exec -it my_container /bin/bash
```

You can list the containers currently existing on your machine by
running:

``` {.bash}
docker ps -a
```

The \"a\" means \"all container\". The `docker ps` command only list
running containers.

Docker containers can be stop (so that they do not use CPU or RAM
ressource):

``` {.bash}
docker stop my_container
```

They can also be deleted:

``` {.bash}
docker rm my_container
```

**It\'s a good idea to keep track of how many containers have been created
as they can rapidly take a lot of space on your machine.**

### [Kitematic](https://kitematic.com/)

[Kitematic](https://kitematic.com/) is a program that provides a
graphical user interface to the *docker* daemon and to Docker Hub. The
software is available for Windows, MacOsx and Linux. Be aware that on
linux the installation may differ depending on the distribution you are
running.

1.  Download and Install [Kitematic](https://kitematic.com/)
2.  Open Kitematic and search for the **uwgeodynamics** image.
3.  Create a container by clicking on the create button.

You should now have a container appearing on the left side of your
kitematic window. The first thing to do now is to create a link between
a local directory (A directory on your physical hard drive) and a volume
directory inside the docker container. A volume is a special directory
that can be accessed from outside the container. It is the location you
will use to save your results.

### Local Installation

This is not recommended and involves installing *Underworld* and all its
dependencies. Docker is highly recommended!!!

#### Requirements

-   Python \>= 3.5
-   A Working version of Underworld2 \>=2.9.0 (Please refer to the
    Underworld documentation)
-   pint \>= 0.8

#### Install

##### from Pip

The UWGeodynamics module can be installed directly from the Python
Package Index:

``` {.bash}
pip install UWGeodynamics
```

##### from sources

The module source files are available through
[github](https://github.com/underworldcode/UWGeodynamics.git)

``` {.bash}
git clone https://github.com/underworldcode/UWGeodynamics.git
```

It can then be installed globally on your system using

``` {.bash}
pip install UWGeodynamics/
```
