    "Dynamic rc settings\n",
    "===================\n",
    "\n",
    "You can dynamically change the default rc settings in a python script or\n",
    "interactively from the python shell. All of the rc settings are stored in a\n",
    "dictionary-like variable called `UWGeodynamics.rcParams`, which is global to\n",
    "the UWGeodynamics package. rcParams can be modified directly, for example::\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    import UWGeodynamics as GEO\n",
    "    GEO.rcParams['solver'] = \"mumps\"\n",
    "    GEO.rcParams['penalty'] = 1e6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The other solver options availabe in Underworld and UWGeodynamics are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* mg          : Geometric multigrid (default).\n",
    "* mumps       : MUMPS parallel direct solver.\n",
    "* superludist : SuperLU parallel direct solver.\n",
    "* superlu     : SuperLU direct solver (serial only).\n",
    "* lu          : LU direct solver (serial only).\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally mg, mumps, superlu and lu are availabe in the PETSc provided by most GNU/Linux Distrubitions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `UWGeodynamics.rcdefaults` command will restore the standard UWGeodynamics\n",
    "default settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is some degree of validation when setting the values of rcParams, see\n",
    "`UWGeodynamics.rcsetup` for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `uwgeodynamicsrc` file\n",
    "=============================\n",
    "\n",
    "UWGeodynamics uses `uwgeodynamicsrc` configuration files to customize all kinds\n",
    "of properties, which we call `rc settings` or `rc parameters`. \n",
    "For now, you can control the defaults of a limited set of property in matplotlib\n",
    "UWGeodynamics looks for `uwgeodynamicsrc` in four\n",
    "locations, in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `uwgeodynamicsrc` in the current working directory, usually used for\n",
    "   specific customizations that you do not want to apply elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `$UWGEODYNAMICSRC` if it is a file, else `$UWGEODYNAMICSRC/uwgeodynamicsrc`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It next looks in a user-specific place, depending on your platform:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - On Linux, it looks in `.config/uwgeodynamics/uwgeodynamicsrc` (or\n",
    "     `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/uwgeodynamics/uwgeodynamicsrc`) if you've customized\n",
    "     your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - On other platforms, it looks in `.uwgeodynamics/uwgeodynamicsrc`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `{INSTALL}/UWGeodynamics/uwgeo-data/uwgeodynamicsrc`, where\n",
    "   `{INSTALL}` is something like\n",
    "   `/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages` on Linux, and maybe\n",
    "   `C:\\\\Python25\\\\Lib\\\\site-packages` on Windows. Every time you\n",
    "   install matplotlib, this file will be overwritten, so if you want\n",
    "   your customizations to be saved, please move this file to your\n",
    "   user-specific matplotlib directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "To display where the currently active `uwgeodynamicsrc` file was\n",
    "loaded from, one can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "  >>> import UWGeodynamics as GEO\n",
    "  >>> GEO.uwgeodynamics_fname()\n",
    "  '/home/foo/.config/uwgeodynamics/uwgeodynamicsrc'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "See below for a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "## _uwgeodynamicsrc-sample:\n",
    "\n",
    "A sample uwgeodynamicsrc file\n",
